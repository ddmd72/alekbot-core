# Deployment Documentation

Quick reference for deploying and managing Alek-Core in production.

---

## Available Guides

### Core Deployment

- **[SCHEDULERS.md](SCHEDULERS.md)** - All Cloud Scheduler jobs: schedule, payload, purpose, cost
- **[KEEP_ALIVE_SETUP.md](KEEP_ALIVE_SETUP.md)** - Cloud Scheduler setup to prevent scale-to-zero ($0.10/month)
- **[LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md)** - Structured logging setup, Cloud Logging queries for developer and AI agents

### Coming Soon

- Cloud Run deployment guide
- Secret Manager setup
- Firestore indexes migration
- Monitoring and alerts setup

## Quick Commands

### Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy from main branch
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-prod.yaml

# Deploy from specific branch
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-prod.yaml --substitutions=BRANCH_NAME=develop
```

### Setup Keep-Alive (Recommended)

```bash
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export CLOUD_RUN_URL="https://your-service.run.app"

./scripts/infrastructure/setup-keep-alive.sh
```

### Check Service Status

```bash
# Cloud Run service
gcloud run services describe alek-bot-prod --region=europe-west1

# Cloud Scheduler jobs
gcloud scheduler jobs list --location=europe-west1

# Recent logs
gcloud logging read 'resource.type=cloud_run_revision' --limit=50
```

## Cost Optimization

| Strategy             | Cost/Month | Pros        | Cons                      |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| **Scale-to-zero**    | $0         | Cheapest    | Cold starts (2-4s)        |
| **Keep-alive pings** | $0.10-1    | Almost free | May still get cold starts |
| **min-instances=1**  | $15-30     | Always warm | Expensive                 |

**Recommendation:** Start with keep-alive pings ($0.10/mo), upgrade to min-instances if needed.

## Node.js Dependencies in the Docker Image

The image bundles two independent Node.js projects for document generation. Both are installed
during the Docker build via `npm install --omit=dev`:

| Directory | npm package | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------|
| `docx_generator/` | `docx` | DOCX file generation (NodeDocxRunner) | Lightweight; no system-level dependencies |
| `pdf_generator/` | `puppeteer ^24.x` | PDF rendering via headless Chromium (NodePuppeteerRunner) | Downloads bundled Chromium (~170 MB) during install |

`pdf_generator/node_modules/` is excluded from the Docker build context via `.dockerignore` — the
`npm install` step in the `Dockerfile` installs it fresh inside the image layer.

Because Puppeteer downloads Chromium at install time, the first `docker build` (or Cloud Build)
after a Puppeteer version change will be slow (~3–5 min for the download). Subsequent builds use
the Docker layer cache as long as `pdf_generator/package.json` is unchanged.
